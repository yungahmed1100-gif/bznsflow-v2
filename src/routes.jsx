// open. Home stays eager: it IS the landing page, so deferring it would only add
// a round trip to the critical path.

// traffic: it is prerendered, so an ad click gets the full HTML immediately and
// the chunk only matters once the visitor types into the form.

// `null` rather than a spinner. The prerendered HTML already contains the fully
// rendered page, so this fallback is only ever visible during a client-side
// navigation to /signin — where a flash of spinner is worse than nothing.
