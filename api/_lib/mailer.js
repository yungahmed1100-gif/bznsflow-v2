// Apps Script transport: OTP delivery, and the CRM sheet row.
//
// Both go to the same deployed web app (apps-script/Code.gs), which is bound to
// the Lead Pipeline CRM spreadsheet and sends mail as ahmed@bznsflowai.com
// natively — the sender-identity problem was solved by hosting the sheet on that
// account, so there is no alias, app password or SMTP credential anywhere here.
//
// WHY THIS WORKS SERVER-SIDE, WHEN IT DOES NOT IN THE BROWSER
// PlaybookModal.jsx has to use `mode: 'no-cors'` and gets an opaque response it
// cannot read, because the Apps Script /exec URL 302s to a googleusercontent
// origin that sends no CORS headers. That is a browser restriction, not an
// Apps Script one. Here there is no origin and no CORS layer: fetch follows the
// redirect and hands back the real JSON, so delivery is actually confirmable —
// which is the difference between "good enough for a lead magnet" and "good
// enough for a login".
//
// The OTP email TEMPLATE deliberately lives in Code.gs, not here. This endpoint
// takes an address and a code, never a subject or a body, so a leaked shared
// secret buys an attacker the ability to send BznsFlow login codes — irritating —
// rather than arbitrary mail from Ahmed's address, which would be an open relay.
