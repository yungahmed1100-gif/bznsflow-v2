// Shared request/response plumbing for the serverless functions.
//
// `send`, `readBody` and `limits` were each copy-pasted into three handlers,
// with the copies already diverging — one had `Vary: Cookie`, one read its env
// inline instead of through a function. Three copies of a response helper is
// three places to remember when a header changes.
//
// api/chat.js keeps its own `reply()` wrapper on top of `send`: that one is
// genuinely different, shaping every response to the widget's invariant that a
// `reply` string is present at every status code.
